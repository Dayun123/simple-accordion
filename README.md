# Simple Accordion

A simple implementation of a JavaScript accordion.

## About

The project at the end of Chris Ferndinandi's [Dom Manipulation](https://vanillajsguides.com/dom-manipulation/) was to build a simple accordion. This is my attempt after reading that short guide. It doesn't follow his example to the letter, it was more the overall concept that I was trying to get right.
